# **Tandem**
### Mission:
**Tandem** helps students connect with others in their unique parking situation, removing the frustration of being parked in, street cleaning, and unexpected tickets. With real-time updates and text notifications, these problems will be a thing of the past.
### How to use:
##### Backend:
First use `cd server` to enter the server directory.
Then, run `npm install` to install the required dependencies.
Finally, run `nodemon server` to start the the backend server. The backend must be running before the frontend for the app to work properly.
By default, the server runs on PORT 4000, but it can be changed in *server/config.env*.
##### Frontend:
After starting the backend, `cd ..` back to the project home directory. 
Then, run `npm install` to install the required dependencies.
Finally, run `npm start` to open the frontend page.
